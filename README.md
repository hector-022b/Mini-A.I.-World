Virtual World for Self-Driving Cars â€“ App Reskin, HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript, Personal Project (In Progress) 
- Built a spatial graph and dynamic viewport editor, generating road borders, buildings, and trees for a 3D 
visual effect.  
- Loaded real-world data from OpenStreetMap for city simulations and created a minimap for navigation. 
- Enhanced the environment for self-driving simulations by incorporating detailed road markings and realistic 
object placement. 
- (Planned): Adding a feature for users to select various pathfinding algorithms for car navigation, showcasing 
different strategies.
